summary
    FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically using randomly generated test cases.
description
    FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically. The programmer provides
    a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods
    or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a
    large number of randomly generated cases.
    
    While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program.
    
    Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined
    in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties,
    observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
    When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.
