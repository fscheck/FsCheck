namespace FsCheck

(*
The implementation in this file is the implementation of SplitMix algorithm given in:

Fast Splittable Pseudorandom Number Generators, Guy L. Steele Jr., Doug Lea and Christine H. Flood.

It is also incorporated as such in JDK 8 in the class SplittableRandom.java.

This algorithm has been tested by the authors and found to have reasonable statistical properties
(as opposed to the algortihm used by FsCheck before, which was taken from Haskell and by its own admission
has "no statistical basis") and is also pretty fast.

The main difference with the paper is that I've chosen here to make an functional API, i.e. where
all the functions are pure and the state is carried explicitly using the type Rnd. 
This approach fits better with how FsCheck Generators work.
