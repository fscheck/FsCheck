# Test data: generators, shrinkers and Arbitrary instances

Test data is produced by test data generators. FsCheck defines default 
generators for some often used types, but you can use your own, and 
will need to define your own generators for any new types you introduce.

Generators have types of the form `Gen<'a>`; this is a generator for values 
of type a. To build your own generators in F#, a computation expression 
called `gen` is provided by FsCheck, and all the functions in the `Gen` module are at your disposal. 
For C#, there are some LINQ methods you can use (select, where) and a number of methods on the `Gen` class.
The name for the methods in F# and C# are largely the same except for casing.

Shrinkers have types of the for `'a -> seq<'a>` aka `Func<T,IEnumerable<T>`; given a value, a shrinker 
produces a sequence of values that are (in some way) smaller than the given value. 
If FsCheck finds a set of values that falsify a given property, it will try 
to make that value smaller than the original (random) value by getting the 
shrinks for the value and trying each one in turn to check that the property 
is still false. If it is, the smaller value becomes the new counter example 
and the shrinking process continues with that value.

Shrinkers have no special support from FsCheck - this is not needed, 
since you have all you need in `seq` computation expressions and the `Seq` module, or in LINQ and IEnumerable.

Finally, an `Arbitrary<'a>` instance packages a generator and shrinker together to be used in properties. 
FsCheck also allows you to register Arbitrary instances in a `Type` to `Arbitrary` dictionary. 
This dictionary is used to find an arbitrary instance for properties that have arguments, 
based on the argument's type.

Arbitrary instances have some helper functions in `Arb`.
    
## Generators

Generators are built from the function `choose`,  which makes a random choice of 
a value from an interval, with a uniform distribution. For example, to make 
a random choice between the elements of a list, use*)

let chooseFromList xs = 
  gen { let! i = Gen.choose (0, List.length xs-1) 
        return List.item i xs }

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=chooseFrom]

### Choosing between alternatives

A generator may take the form `Gen.oneof <sequence of generators>`
which chooses among the generators in the list with equal probability. For example, 
this generates a random boolean which is true with probability one half:*)

Gen.oneof [ gen { return true }; gen { return false } ]

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=chooseBool]

We can control the distribution of results using `frequency`
instead. `frequency` chooses a generator from the list randomly, but weighs the probability of 
choosing each alternative by the factor given. For example, this generates true two thirds of the time.*)

Gen.frequency [ (2, gen { return true }); (1, gen { return false })]

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=chooseBool2]
    
### The size of test data

Test data generators have an implicit size parameter; FsCheck begins by 
generating small test cases, and gradually increases the size as testing 
progresses. Different test data generators interpret the size parameter 
in different ways: some ignore it, while the list generator, for example, 
interprets it as an upper bound on the length of generated lists. You are 
free to use it as you wish to control your own test data generators.

You can obtain the value of the size parameter using `sized`. `sized g` calls `g`, passing it 
the current size as a parameter. For example, to generate natural
 numbers in the range 0 to size, use*)

Gen.sized <| fun s -> Gen.choose (0,s)

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=sizedInt]

The purpose of size control is to ensure that test cases are large enough to reveal errors, 
while remaining small enough to test fast. Sometimes the default size control does not achieve 
this. For example, towards the end of a test run arbitrary lists may have up to 50 elements, 
so arbitrary lists of lists may have up to 2500, which is too large for efficient testing. In 
such cases it can be useful to modify the size parameter explicitly. You can do so using 
`resize`.

`resize n g` invokes generator `g` with size parameter `n`. The size parameter should never be 
negative. For example, to generate a random matrix it might be appropriate to take the square 
root of the original size:*)

let matrix gen = Gen.sized <| fun s -> Gen.resize (s|>float|>sqrt|>int) gen

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=matrixGen]

### Generating recursive data types

Generators for recursive data types are easy to express using `oneof` or `frequency` to choose 
between constructors, and F#'s computation expressions or C# LINQ to form a generator for each case. 
There are also `map` functions for arity up to 6 to lift constructors and functions into the `Gen` type. 
For example, if the type of trees is defined by *)

type Tree = Leaf of int | Branch of Tree * Tree

(**
then a generator for trees might be defined by*)

let rec unsafeTree() = 
  Gen.oneof [ Gen.map Leaf Arb.generate<int> 
              Gen.map2 (fun x y -> Branch (x,y)) (unsafeTree()) (unsafeTree())]

(**
In C#, we elide the type because it is quite a bit more verbose than in F# - assume the typical composite
of having an abstract superclass Tree with two subclasses, one for Leaf and one fro Branch. Basically this is
the code F# generates for the type definition above. Assuming that, `unsafeTree` in C# looks like:

    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=unsafeTree]

However, a recursive generator like this may fail to terminate with a 
StackOverflowException, or produce very large results. To avoid this, 
recursive generators should always use the size control mechanis:*)

let tree =
    let rec tree' s = 
        match s with
        | 0 -> Gen.map Leaf Arb.generate<int>
        | n when n>0 -> 
            let subtree = tree' (n/2)
            Gen.oneof [ Gen.map Leaf Arb.generate<int> 
                        Gen.map2 (fun x y -> Branch (x,y)) subtree subtree]
        | _ -> invalidArg "s" "Only positive arguments are allowed"
    Gen.sized tree'

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=safeTree]

Note that

- We guarantee termination by forcing the result to be a leaf when the size is zero. 
- We halve the size at each recursion, so that the size gives an upper bound on the number of nodes in the tree. We are free to interpret the size as we will. 
- The fact that we share the subtree generator between the two branches of a Branch does not mean that we generate the same tree in each case.

    
### Useful Generator Combinators

If `g` is a generator for type `t`, then 

- `two g` generates a pair of t's, 
- `three g` generates a triple of t's, 
- `four g` generates a quadruple of t's, 
- If xs is a list, then `elements xs` generates an arbitrary element of xs.
- If xs is a list, then `growingElements xs` generates an arbitrary element among an initial segment of xs. The size of this initial segment increases with the size parameter.
- `listOfLength n g` generates a list of exactly n t's. 
- `listOf g` generates a list of t's whose length is determined by the size parameter
- `nonEmptyListOf g` generates a non-empty list of t's whose length is determined by the size parameter.
- `constant v` generates the value v.
- `where p g` or `filter p g` generates t's that satisfy the predicate p. Make sure there is a high chance that the predicate is satisfied.
- `tryWhere p g` or `tryFilter p g` generates Some t's that satisfy the predicate p, and None if none are found. (After 'trying hard')
- If xs is a sequence, then `shuffle xs` generates a random permutation of xs.

All the generator combinators are functions on the Gen module. In C#, the names are the same just capitalized differently.

### Generator examples

The following examples use `Gen.sample` in order to show example output. In
general, you shouldn't use `Gen.sample` when writing properties, but it can be
helpful when developing or troubleshooting a useful custom generator.

Please be aware that due to the non-deterministic nature of FsCheck, the output
of calling `Gen.sample` will, in most cases, differ between calls.

The `Gen.sample` function takes two arguments, in addition to the generator
from which it samples. The first argument is the [size](#The-size-of-test-data)
of the generated data. Some generators (like `Gen.constant` and `Gen.elements`)
don't use the `size` argument. For these generators, any integer value will do.

The second argument is the number of sample values to generate. Most examples
below use `Gen.sample` to generate a small list of example values, for example
a list of ten generated values.

#### Constant

The `Gen.constant` function is perhaps the simplest, and easiest, generator to
understand. Even though it's part of a system that generates random values,
this particular generator always returns the same value:*)

(***define-output:ConstantExample***)
Gen.constant (1, "Foo") |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**In this example, the constant is a complex value (a tuple); it can also be a
simple value, as for example a string or an integer. Since `Gen.constant`
doesn't rely on the `size` argument, it's `0` in this example, but any value
would do; it wouldn't change the result. As you can see from the return value,
all singular elements returned is the same tuple.*)

(***include-it:ConstantExample***)

(**Since the purpose of FsCheck is to generate random values, you shouldn't
need to use `Gen.constant` often. Still, it can come in handy if you need to
keep the value of a particular type constant while you vary other values.

#### Choose

You can use the `Gen.choose` function to create a generator of singular integer
values between a minimum and maximum value, both inclusive:*)

(***define-output:ChooseBetweenZeroAndNineExample***)
Gen.choose (0, 9) |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**This example generates a single integer value between 0 and 9. Since
`Gen.choose` doesn't rely on the `size` argument, it's `0` in this example,
but any value would do; it wouldn't change the result.

While `Gen.choose (0, 9)` generates a single integer value, `Gen.sample 0 10`
generates 10 sample values:*)

(***include-it:ChooseBetweenZeroAndNineExample***)

(**If you supply values in the 'wrong order', `Gen.choose` will follow
[Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) and 'know
what you meant':*)

(***define-output:ChooseWhenLowIsHigherThanHigh***)
Gen.choose (99, 42) |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**In this example, the first value is greater than the second value, but
`Gen.choose` will happily interpret this as a range, and produce values between
42 and 99, both included:*)

(***include-it:ChooseWhenLowIsHigherThanHigh***)

(**Since both values are included, if you set both to the same value, you'll
effectively constrain the generator to that single value, and it'll behave like
`Gen.constant`.

#### Elements

You can use the `Gen.elements` function to create a generator of singular
values drawn from a collection of possible values. The collection is inclusive,
which means that both the first and last element, as well as all elements
between, can be drawn.

In the following example, a list of arbitrary integers define the collection of
possible values. The result is a generator that creates `int` values guaranteed
to be one of these values. Since `Gen.elements` doesn't rely on the `size`
argument, it's `0` in this example, but any value would do; it wouldn't change
the result.*)

(***define-output:ElementsExample***)
Gen.elements [42; 1337; 7; -100; 1453; -273] |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**The result of this expression is a list of ten sample values. Each value is
a single integer drawn from the collection of numbers:*)

(***include-it:ElementsExample***)

(**All elements are equally likely to be drawn from the collection; we say that
the random function has a uniform distribution. One easy way to affect the
distribution is to put more than one identical element into the collection:*)

(***define-output:SkewedElementsExample***)
Gen.elements ["foo"; "foo"; "bar"] |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**In the above example, the value `"foo"` appears twice, so is twice as likely
to be drawn from the collection:*)

(***include-it:SkewedElementsExample***)

(**The above examples all use `list` values as input, but you can use any `seq`
expression, including `list` and `array` values, as long as the sequence is
finite.

#### GrowingElements

Essentially `Gen.growingElements` is like `Gen.elements` but also taking `size` into account.

You can use the `Gen.growingElements` function to create a generator of singular
values drawn *among an initial segment* of possible values. The size of this
initial segment increases with the `size` parameter.

In the following example, a list of ten characters define the collection of
possible values. The result is a generator that creates `char` values guaranteed
to be one of these values. Since `Gen.growingElements` relies on the `size`
argument, it's `3` in this example, which means only values from the segment
`['a'; 'b'; 'c']` will be returned.*)

(***define-output:GrowingElementsExample***)
Gen.growingElements ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'e'; 'f'; 'g'; 'h'; 'i'; 'j'] |> Gen.sample 3 10

(**The result of this expression is a list of ten sample values. Each value is
a single character drawn from the segment `['a'; 'b'; 'c']`:*)

(***include-it:GrowingElementsExample***)

(**Let's run `Gen.growingElements` again, with the same input but with size `7`:*)

(***define-output:GrowingElementsAnotherExample***)
Gen.growingElements ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'e'; 'f'; 'g'; 'h'; 'i'; 'j'] |> Gen.sample 7 10

(**The result of this expression is a list of ten sample values. Each value is
now a single character drawn from the segment `['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'; 'e'; 'f'; 'g']`:*)

(***include-it:GrowingElementsAnotherExample***)

(**The above examples all use `list` values as input, but you can use any `seq`
expression, including `list` and `array` values, as long as the sequence is
finite.

#### Map

Sometimes, you need to use a generator of one type in order to create a
generator of another type. For instance, you may need a `byte` value between 0
and 127. That sounds just like a job for `Gen.choose`, but unfortunately,
`Gen.choose (0, 127)` is a `Gen<int>`, and not a `Gen<byte>`. One way to
produce a `Gen<byte>` from a `Gen<int>` is to use `Gen.map`:*)

(***define-output:IntToByteMapExample***)
Gen.choose (0, 127) |> Gen.map byte |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**This example uses the `byte` _function_ to cast any `int` created by
`Gen.choose (0, 127)` to a `byte` value:*)

(***include-it:IntToByteMapExample***)

(**This is only a basic example of the concept of `Gen.map`. In this particular
example, you could also have used `Gen.elements [0uy..127uy]` to achieve the
same result without using `Gen.map`, so let's consider a second
example.

Assume that you need to create a date in a particular month; e.g. November
2019. You can do that by creating an integer for the day of the month, and then
combine `Gen.map` with an anymous function to get the desired date:*)

(***define-output:MapIntToDateExample***)
Gen.choose (1, 30)
|> Gen.map (fun i -> DateTime(2019, 11, i).ToString "u")
|> Gen.sample 0 10

(**In this example, the generated `DateTime` value is immediately formatted as
a `string`, so that the output is more readable:*)

(***include-it:MapIntToDateExample***)

(**This causes the resulting generator to have the type `Gen<string>`, but if
you omit calling `ToString "u"`, its type would have been `Gen<DateTime>`.

#### Lists

You can generate lists from individual value generators using `Gen.listOf`,
`Gen.listOfLength`, and `Gen.nonEmptyListOf`. These functions are
*combinators*, which means that they don't generate individual values
themselves, but rather use another generator to build values. For instance,
you can use `Gen.constant` to generate lists that all contain the same value:*)

(***define-output:ConstantListOfExample***)
Gen.constant 42 |> Gen.listOf |> Gen.sample 1 10

(**This combination uses `Gen.constant 42` as an individual generator, and then
generates lists containing the the number 42. While the value(s) in the list is
always 42, the length of the generated lists varies.*)

(***include-it:ConstantListOfExample***)

(**The length of the generated list is determined by the `size` argument. In
this example, the `size` argument is `1`, so the generated lists are short.
Note that while there's a correlation beteen `size` and the length of the
lists, you can't rely on a deterministic length. For that, there's
`Gen.listOfLength`:*)

(***define-output:ListOfLengthExample***)
Gen.choose (24, 42) |> Gen.listOfLength 5 |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**This example uses `Gen.choose (24, 42)` in order to generate individual
integer values between 24 and 42. It then pipes this generator into
`Gen.listOfLength 5` in order to generate lists with exactly five elements:*)

(***include-it:ListOfLengthExample***)

(**Notice that all sample lists have exactly five elements.

You can also use `Gen.nonEmptyListOf` to create lists that are guaranteed to
have at least one element. Like the other list generators, it uses a
single-value generator to generate its elements:*)

(***define-output:NonEmptyListExample***)
Gen.elements ["foo"; "bar"; "baz"] |> Gen.nonEmptyListOf |> Gen.sample 20 4

(**Like `Gen.listOf`, `Gen.nonEmptyListOf` uses `size` to control the length
of the generated lists. They may still be small, but the larger the `size`
argument, the larger the lists may become.*)

(***include-it:NonEmptyListExample***)

(**In this example, each element is drawn from the small set "foo", "bar", and
"baz". The lists are guaranteed to have at least a single element, but may be
longer.

#### Shuffle

You can use the `Gen.shuffle` function to create a generator that generates a
random permutation of a given finite sequence.

In the following example, the
[metasyntactic variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable)
"foo", "bar", "baz", and "qux" define the input sequence:*)

(***define-output:ShuffleExample***)
Gen.shuffle ["foo"; "bar"; "baz"; "qux"] |> Gen.sample 0 6

(**Since `Gen.shuffle` doesn't rely on the `size` argument, it's `0` in this
example, but any value would do; it wouldn't change the result.

The result of this expression is a list of lists, where each list contains
the original input list, but shuffled:*)

(***include-it:ShuffleExample***)

(**The above example uses a `list` value as input, but you can use any `seq`
expression, including `list` and `array` values, as long as the sequence is
finite.

All shuffles are equally likely; the input order isn't excluded, so the
output may be the same as the input. Due to the nature of combinatorics, this
is more likely to happen the smaller the input list is.

#### Tuples

Sometimes you need to generate tuples of values. You can use the functions
`Gen.two`, `Gen.three`, and `Gen.four` to turn a single-value generator into a
generator of tuples.

Imagine that you need to generate two-dimensional points; you may, for
instance, be implementing
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
Points can be modelled as tuples of numbers. If you're modelling a grid, you
can use integers:*)

(***define-output:GenTwoIntegerExample***)
Gen.choose (-100, 100) |> Gen.two |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**`Gen.two` uses a single-value generator to create a generator of two-element
tuples. This example generates 10 sample points, where each coordinate is
between -100 and 100:*)

(***include-it:GenTwoIntegerExample***)

(**If you want to model a coordinate system in three-dimensional space, you may
decide to use floating points instead:*)

(***define-output:GenThreeFloatExample***)
Gen.elements [-10.0..0.01..10.0] |> Gen.three |> Gen.sample 0 10

(**In this example, you first use `Gen.elements` to draw a floating point value
from between -10 and 10, with two decimals; that defines a `Gen<float>`.
Second, `Gen.three` takes that `Gen<float>` and turns it into a
`Gen<float * float * float>`:*)

(***include-it:GenThreeFloatExample***)

(**Finally, `Gen.four` transforms a single-value generator into a generator of
four-element tuples. As all the other *combinators* in the `Gen` module, you
can combine it with other functions to define more specific values. Imagine,
for instance, that you need to create `System.Version` values. This type, which
captures a version of something, for example an operating system, or a library,
models version numbers as a composite of four numbers: *major*, *minor*,
*build*, and *revision* - all integers. One of the constructor overloads of
this class takes all four numbers, so you can combine `Gen.four` with `Gen.map`
to create Version values:*)

(***define-output:GenFourVersionExample***)
Gen.choose (0, 9)
|> Gen.four
|> Gen.map (System.Version >> string)
|> Gen.sample 0 10

(**This example starts with `Gen.choose (0, 9)` to define a `Gen<int>` that
creates integer values betwen 0 and 9 (both included). Second, you pipe the
`Gen<int>` value into `Gen.four`, which returns a `Gen<int * int * int * int>`.
Third, you can pipe that generator into `Gen.map`, using the constructor
overload of `Version` that takes four integers; in F# 4, constructors can be
treated as functions, and a constructor with four arguments can be treated as a
function that takes a four-element tuple.*)

(***include-it:GenFourVersionExample***)

(**This example composes the `Version` constructor with the `string` function,
in order to produce a more readable output. The resulting generator has the
type `Gen<string>`, but if you remove the `string` composition, the type would
be `Gen<Version>.`
    
## Default Generators and Shrinkers based on type

FsCheck defines default test data generators and shrinkers for some often used types, for example
unit, bool, byte, int, float, char, string, DateTime, lists, array 1D and 2D, Set, Map, objects and 
functions from and to any of the above. Furthermore, by using reflection, FsCheck can derive 
default implementations of record types, discriminated unions, tuples, enums and basic immutable classes in terms 
of any primitive types that are defined (either in FsCheck or by you).

You do not need to define these explicity for every property: FsCheck can provide a property with 
appropriate generators and shrinkers for all of the property's arguments, if it knows them or 
can derive them. Usually you can let type inference do the job of finding out these types 
based on your properties. However if you want to coerce FsCheck to use a particular generator 
and shrinker, you can do so by providing the appropriate type annotations.

FsCheck packages a generator and shrinker for a particular type in an `Arbitrary` type. You can 
provide FsCheck with an Arbitrary instance for your own types, by defining static members that 
return an instance of a subclass of `Arbitrary<'a>`:*)

type MyGenerators =
  static member Tree() =
      {new Arbitrary<Tree>() with
          override x.Generator = tree
          override x.Shrinker t = Seq.empty }

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=MyGenerators]

Replace the `'a` by the particular type you are defining an Arbitary instance for. 
Only the `Generator` method needs to be defined; `Shrinker` by default returns the empty 
sequence which means no shrinking will be done for this type).

As the F# code shows, you can create your own subclass of Arbitrary and return that, or you can use one of the `Arb.from`
methods or functions.

Now, to register all Arbitrary instances in this class:*)

Arb.register<MyGenerators>()

(**
    [lang=csharp,file=../csharp/TestData.cs,key=register]

FsCheck now knows about `Tree` types, and can not only generate Tree values, but also e.g. lists, tuples and 
option values containing Trees:*)

(***define-output:RevRevTree***)
let revRevTree (xs:list<Tree>) = 
  List.rev(List.rev xs) = xs
Check.Quick revRevTree

(***include-output:RevRevTree***)

(**
To generate types with a generic type argument, e.g.*)

type Box<'a> = Whitebox of 'a | Blackbox of 'a

(**
you can use the same principle. So the class `MyGenerators` can be writtten as follows:*)

let boxGen<'a> : Gen<Box<'a>> = 
    gen { let! a = Arb.generate<'a>
          return! Gen.elements [ Whitebox a; Blackbox a] }

type MyGenerators =
    static member Tree() =
        {new Arbitrary<Tree>() with
            override x.Generator = tree
            override x.Shrinker t = Seq.empty }
    static member Box() = Arb.fromGen boxGen

(**
Notice that we use the function `generate<'a>` from the Arb module to get the generator 
for the type argument of `Box`. This allows you to define generators recursively. Similarly, there is 
a function `shrink<'a>`. Look at the FsCheck source for examples of default Arbitrary implementations 
to get a feeling of how to write such Arbitrary instances. The Arb module should help you with this task as well.

Now, the following property can be checked:*)

(***define-output:RevRevBox***)
let revRevBox (xs:list<Box<int>>) = 
  List.rev(List.rev xs) = xs
Check.Quick revRevBox

(***include-output:RevRevBox***)

(**
Note that the class needs not be tagged with attributes in any way. FsCheck determines the type of 
the generator by the return type of each static member.

Also note that in this case we actually didn't need to write a generator or shrinker: FsCheck can 
derive suitable instances using reflection for discriminated unions, record types and enums.
    
## Useful methods on the Arb module

- `Arb.from<'a>` returns the registered Arbitrary instance for the given type 'a
- `Arb.fromGen` makes a new Arbitrary instance from just a given generator - the shrinker return the empty sequence
- `Arb.fromGenShrink` make a new Arbitrary instance from a given generator and shrinker. This is equivalent to implementing Arbitrary yourself, but may be shorter.
- `Arb.generate<'a>` returns the generator of the registered Arbitrary instance for the given type 'a
- `Arb.shrink` return the immediate shrinks of the registered Arbitrary instance for the given value
- `Arb.convert` given conversion functions to ('a ->'b) and from ('b ->'a), converts an Arbitrary<'a> instance to an Arbitrary<'b>
- `Arb.filter` filters the generator and shrinker for a given Arbitrary instance to contain only those values that match with the given filter function
- `Arb.mapFilter` maps the generator and filter the shrinkers for a given Arbitrary instance. Mapping the generator is sometimes faster, e.g. for a PositiveInt it is faster to take the absolute value than to filter the negative values.
- `Arb.Default` is a type that contains all the default Arbitrary instances as they are shipped and registerd by FsCheck by default. This is useful when you override a default generator - typically this is because you want to filter certain values from it, and then you need to be able to refer to the default generator in your overriding generator.*)
