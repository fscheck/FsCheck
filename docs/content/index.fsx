FsCheck
=======

FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically. The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases. While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program. Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties, observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators. When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.

Users have also created integrations with [Expecto](https://github.com/haf/Expecto), 
[Fuchu](https://github.com/mausch/Fuchu) and 
[AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) that 
you can [find on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=fscheck).

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is also available in [Japanese](ja/index.html).

 * [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) to get started.

 * [Properties](Properties.html) descibes FsCheck's language to express tests - 
   in other frameworks these are often called parametrized tests or
   generative tests. FsCheck calls them properties.

 * [Generating test data](TestData.html) describes how to guide FsCheck to
   generate better data or to stop it from generating data that doesn't make
   sense for what you're trying to test. FsCheck has a flexible language to describe test 
   value generators and shrinkers, and apply them to your properties.

 * [Model based testing](StatefulTesting.html) is a particular testing approach
   where FsCheck generates a large number of random operations on an object or data
   structure, and the results of each operation are compared with a (much simpler)
   model.

 * [Running Tests](RunningTests.html) explains various ways to run FsCheck tests and how to
   integrate with unit testing frameworks.

 * [Tips and tricks](TipsAndTricks.html) 

 * [API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules
   and functions.

 * [Model based testing vNext (Experimental)](StatefulTestingNew.html) is a relatively new addition for
   a more powerful model based testing. It's still a bit rough around the edges, some things may not
   work, and it is subject to change (i.e. no promises regarding semantic versioning and breaking changes). Regardless,
   feedback is very much appreciated!
