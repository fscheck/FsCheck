Documentation
-----------------------

The documentation is also available in [Japanese](https://github.com/fsharp/FsCheck/blob/master/docs/Documentation_ja.md)

 * [QuickStart](QuickStart.html) to get started.

 * [Properties](Properties.html) descibes FsCheck's language to express tests - 
   in other frameworks these are often called parametrized tests or
   generative tests. FsCheck calls them properties.

 * [Generating test data](TestData.html) describes how to guide FsCheck to
   generate better data or to stop it from generating data that doesn't make
   sense for what you're trying to test. FsCheck has a flexible language to describe test 
   value generators and shrinkers, and apply them to your properties.

 * [Model based testing](StatefulTesting.html) is a particular testing approach
   where FsCheck generates a large number of random operations on an object or data
   structure, and the results of each operation are compared with a (much simpler)
   model.

 * [Running Tests](RunningTests.html) explains various ways to run FsCheck tests and how to
   integrate with unit testing frameworks.

 * [Tips and tricks](TipsAndTricks.html) 

 * [API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules
   and functions.
