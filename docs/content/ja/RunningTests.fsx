# Running tests

This section describes the various ways in which you can run FsCheck tests:

* FsCheck has a built-in test runner that is easy to invoke from F# Interactive, commandline program or any test framework. 
It writes the result of tests to standard output, and you can configure the FsCheck runner to throw an exception on test failure.

* FsCheck.Xunit is a tight integration with xUnit.NET that allows you to specify properties and generators in a terse way. Tests written
this way look like native xUnit.NET tests.

* FsCheck allows you to register an IRunner implementation that it calls on each outcome and each individual test it runs. This allows
a tighter integration with a specific test framework, and offers more control over printing of results.

## Using the built-in test runner

### From an fsx file or a command line runner

This method should by now be familiar to you if you've read the previous sections in this guide. Simply write your property as a 
function, and invoke one of the methods on the `Check` type.

There are basically two main variants of methods on `Check`: `Check.One` and `Check.All`. 

`Check.One` runs the tests for a single property. It takes as argument an instance of the `Config` type, which allows you to configure
many aspects of how the FsCheck test runner works, among others the size of the test data and the random seed used (so you can reproduce
a run). Most of the methods on `Check` are a short-hand for running a test with a particular configuration. For example, `Check.Quick` 
is equivalent to `Check.One(Config.Quick, <property>)`.

Take note of `Config.Verbose` and `Check.Verbose`. These will print the arguments for each test, and are useful for example if
your test loops infinitely on some inputs.

Also take not of `Check.QuickThrowOnFailure` and `Check.VerboseThrowOnFailure`. These are intended to be used from unit tests executed
through another test framework's unit tests. They'll call the FsCheck runner directly and configure it such that is throws on failure;
in all frameworks I'm aware of this signals that the test has failed and so is an easy way to integrate FsCheck tests with unit tests 
you may already have.

### Testing grouped properties with Check.All

Usually, you'll write more than one property to test. FsCheck allows you to group together properties as static members of a class: *)
type ListProperties =
  static member ``reverse of reverse is original`` (xs:list<int>) = List.rev(List.rev xs) = xs
  static member ``reverse is original`` (xs:list<int>) = List.rev xs = xs
(**These can be checked at once using:*)

(***define-output:ListProperties***)
Check.QuickAll<ListProperties>()

(**FsCheck now also prints the name of each test:*)

(***include-output:ListProperties***)

(**Since all top level functions of a a module are also compiled as static member of a class with the name of the module, 
you can also use Check.QuickAll to test all the top level functions in a certain module. 
However, the type of a module is not directly accessible via F#, so you can use the following trick:*)

(***define-output:ListProperties2***)
Check.QuickAll typeof<ListProperties>.DeclaringType

(**
Notice also the counterpart of `Check.Verbose`: `Check.VerboseAll`.

### Running tests using only modules

Arbitrary instances are given as static members of classes, and properties can be grouped together 
as static members of classes. Top level let functions are compiled as static member of their 
enclosing module (which is compiled as a class), and so you can simply define your properties and generators as 
top level let-bound functions, and then register all generators and and all properties at once using the following trick:*)

(***define-output:Marker***)
let myprop (i:int) = i >= 0
let mygen = Arb.Default.Int32() |> Arb.mapFilter (fun i -> Math.Abs i) (fun i -> i >= 0)
let helper = "a string"
let private helper' = true

type Marker = class end
Arb.registerByType (typeof<Marker>.DeclaringType)
Check.QuickAll (typeof<Marker>.DeclaringType)

(***include-output:Marker***)

(**
The Marker type is just any type defined in the module, to be able to get to the module's Type. F# offers no way 
to get to a module's Type directly.

FsCheck determines the intent of the function based on its return type:

* Properties: public functions that return unit, bool, Property or function of any arguments to those types 
or Lazy value of any of those types. So `myprop` is the only property that is run; `helper'` also returns bool but is private.
* Arbitrary instances: return Arbitrary<_>

All other functions are respectfully ignored. If you have top level functions that return types that FsCheck will 
do something with, but do not want them checked or registered, just make them private. FsCheck will ignore those functions.

## Using FsCheck.Xunit

TODO

## Implementing IRunner 

### Example 1: to integrate FsCheck with other unit testing frameworks

The `Config` type that can be passed to the `Check.One` or `Check.All` methods takes an `IRunner` as argument. This i
nterface has the following methods:

* `OnStartFixture` is called when FsCheck is testing all the methods on a type, before starting any tests.
* `OnArguments` is called after every test, passing the implementation the test number, the arguments and the every function. 
* `OnShrink` is called at every succesful shrink.
* `OnFinished` is called with the name of the test and the outcome of the overall test run. This is used in the example below 
to call Assert statements from a particular unit testing framework - allowing FsCheck to integrate easily. You can leverage 
another unit testing framework's ability to setup and tear down tests, have a nice graphical runner etc.*)

open Xunit

let xUnitRunner =
  { new IRunner with
      member x.OnStartFixture t = ()
      member x.OnArguments (ntest,args, every) = ()
      member x.OnShrink(args, everyShrink) = ()
      member x.OnFinished(name,testResult) = 
          match testResult with 
          | TestResult.True _ -> Assert.True(true)
          | _ -> Assert.True(false, Runner.onFinishedToString name testResult) 
  }
   
let withxUnitConfig = { Config.Default with Runner = xUnitRunner }

(**
### Example 2: to customize printing of generated arguments

By default, FsCheck prints generated arguments using `sprintf "%A"`, or structured formatting. This usually does what you expect, 
i.e. for primitive types the value, for objects the ToString override and so on. If it does not (A motivating case is 
testing with COM objects - overriding ToString is not an option and structured formatting does not do anything useful with it), 
you can use the `label` combinator to solve this on a per property basis, but a more structured solution can be achieved by 
implementing `IRunner`. For example:*)
    
let formatterRunner formatter =
  { new IRunner with
      member x.OnStartFixture t =
          printf "%s" (Runner.onStartFixtureToString t)
      member x.OnArguments (ntest,args, every) =
          printf "%s" (every ntest (args |> List.map formatter))
      member x.OnShrink(args, everyShrink) =
          printf "%s" (everyShrink (args |> List.map formatter))
      member x.OnFinished(name,testResult) = 
          let testResult' = match testResult with 
                              | TestResult.False (testData,origArgs,shrunkArgs,outCome,seed) -> 
                                  TestResult.False (testData,origArgs |> List.map formatter, shrunkArgs |> List.map formatter,outCome,seed)
                              | t -> t
          printf "%s" (Runner.onFinishedToString name testResult') 
  }
